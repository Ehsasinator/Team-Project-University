# Team-Project-University

This is the team project which contains the implementation of the AI doodle guessing model from my other repo linked here: https://github.com/Ehsasinator/AI-doodle-guesser

I used the AI trainer to create a h5 file. In this project, i used a python file to run the h5 file AI neural network, which communicates through a flask server to my java Backend to send predictions to my Frontend.

My Team and I created this project using Angular Springboot, for more information click the team34 folder to see a more detailed readME
